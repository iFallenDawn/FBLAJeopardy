# FBLAJeopardy
Created for FBLA State Leadership Conference 2019 for Computer Game and Simulation Programming
Can easily switch the categories out for different topics.
# Overview
Two (2) parts: a prejudged project and a presentation. Competitors must complete both parts for award eligibility.
## Topic
You are to create a game designed to test a member’s knowledge of FBLA.  The game must produce questions to be presented to the user comprising a minimum of five different FBLA related topics. Topics may include competitive events, business skills, national officers and/or running for national office, national sponsors/partners, basic parliamentary procedure, national conference (NFLC and NLC) dates/locations, FBLA history, etc.  The game must be winnable.  For example, you must implement a system of rewards/penalties such as points, tokens, or levels.  Questions should be drawn from a question bank that presents the user a different assortment of questions every run of the game.  There must be an increase in difficulty as the levels increase.

The game must be compatible with a Windows 7 or newer operating system.  
The game should be secure and bug free.  
The game should utilize two of the following: keyboard, touchscreen, and/or mouse.  
The game must be compatible for a maximum ESRB rating of E10+.  
The game should have an instructional display.  
The game should have credits indicating who completed each portion/component of the development process.  
The game should have a menu with an option to quit at any point.  

## Skills
This event tests the programmer’s skill in designing a functional interactive simulation/game that will both entertain and educate/inform the player.

## Guidelines
Choose a programming language or game/animation engine to create a standalone executable program that will display creativity, programming skill, and convey the message of the topic.  
The program must run on Windows 7 or a higher computer.  
Data must be free of viruses/malware. Any entry with contaminated data will not be judged.  
All data and programs should be contained in a master folder named STATE_ SCHOOL where your state and school are listed in that folder name format. Outside of the master folder, create a shortcut to the executable file. If the program requires a runtime player, create a shortcut outside the master folder to launch the runtime player installer.  
Must be graphical in nature, not text based.  
An initial title page with the game title, user interface control instructions, and active buttons for Play and Quit.  
A quit command programmed to the escape key.  
The program should be shown to the judges.
